# Spinning globe with per Capita Electric Power Comsumption (in 2014 in kWh) markers using React and D3.js



Creates a spinning globe with countries and markers representing per capita electric power consumption.


Note: This visualization constantly recalculates and reprojects the position of over 4000 markers and thus needs a lot of computation power. Older computer and mobile devices might struggle with the rendering process. Furthermore the visualization is only optimized for Chrome browsers and might look different than expected when opened in other browsers.

Inspired by Curran Kelleher's globe in D3.
